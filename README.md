CarHive

It simplifies car sharing while ensuring secure and transparent interactions for all participants.

Project Overview:

CarHive is a decentralized car-sharing platform designed to connect car owners with individuals seeking temporary vehicle access.
Leveraging blockchain technology, CarHive removes intermediaries, ensuring trust, security, and cost-efficiency. 
Car owners can list their vehicles, set rental terms, and receive payments directly via smart contracts. Renters enjoy flexible rental options, 
lower costs, and tamper-proof agreements, while all parties benefit from a seamless and transparent system.

Key Feautures:
1. Smart Contracts for Rentals: Automates rental agreements, tracking durations, managing payments, and enforcing cancellation or late-return policies.
2. Decentralized User Management: Secure login and identity verification using decentralized protocols like ENS or SIWE.
3. Car Listings and Search: Owners can list vehicles with detailed descriptions, availability, and dynamic pricing. Renters can search and filter based on location, price, and car type.
4. Rental History Tracking: Decentralized storage for rental history and metadata, ensuring accountability and easy retrieval.

Why CarHive?
1. Trust and Transparency: Blockchain ensures immutable rental agreements and secure transactions without intermediaries.
2. Cost-Efficiency: Direct interaction between owners and renters reduces platform fees and overhead costs.
3. Flexibility: Renters can access a wide range of vehicles with personalized search and rental options.
4. Decentralized Storage: Metadata such as vehicle details and rental history are securely stored off-chain, protecting user privacy.


How It Works

1. Account Creation: Users create accounts and verify their identities through decentralized identity protocols.
2. Car Listing: Owners list vehicles with details like availability, pricing, and photos.
3. Search and Rent: Renters browse available cars, filter by preferences, and initiate rental agreements through smart contracts.
4. Rental Agreement: The smart contract handles payment, rental duration, and security deposit management.
5. Track and Review: Users can access detailed rental history and provide ratings to enhance trust within the community.
